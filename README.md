# Data Structure Repository: FIFO and LIFO Buffers, Linked List App

---

## Description

Welcome to the Data Structure Repository! Here, you'll find implementations of fundamental data structures essential for efficient programming. This repository includes:

- **FIFO_BUFFER_driver:** Implementation of a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer, also known as a queue, providing functionalities for enqueueing and dequeueing elements.
- **LIFO_BUFFER_driver:** Implementation of a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) buffer, commonly referred to as a stack, offering operations for pushing and popping elements.
- **LINKED_LIST_APP:** Application utilizing a linked list data structure, showcasing its versatility in various scenarios such as managing dynamic collections of data.

These data structures are vital tools in software development for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. Whether you're a beginner learning the basics or an experienced developer refining your skills, this repository offers valuable resources for understanding and implementing data structures effectively.
